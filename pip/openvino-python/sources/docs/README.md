# Inference Engine Python* API

This API provides a simplified interface for Inference Engine functionality that allows you to:

* Handle the models
* Load and configure Inference Engine plugins based on device names
* Perform inference in synchronous and asynchronous modes with arbitrary number of infer requests (the number of infer requests may be limited by target device capabilities)
