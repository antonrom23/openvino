## OpenVINO™ Toolkit

OpenVINO™ toolkit quickly deploys applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the toolkit extends computer vision (CV) workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance. The OpenVINO™ toolkit includes the Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit (DLDT).

OpenVINO™ toolkit:

- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge
- Supports heterogeneous execution across an Intel® CPU, Intel® Integrated Graphics, Intel® FPGA,  Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 and Intel® Vision Accelerator Design with Intel® Movidius™ VPUs
- Speeds time-to-market via an easy-to-use library of computer vision functions and pre-optimized kernels
- Includes optimized calls for computer vision standards, including OpenCV\* and OpenCL™
