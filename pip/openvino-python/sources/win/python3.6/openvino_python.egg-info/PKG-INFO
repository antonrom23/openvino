Description: # Inference Engine Python* API
        
        This API provides a simplified interface for Inference Engine functionality that allows you to:
        
        * Handle the models
        * Load and configure Inference Engine plugins based on device names
        * Perform inference in synchronous and asynchronous modes with arbitrary number of infer requests (the number of infer requests may be limited by target device capabilities)
